* **STM32 Microcontroller**: The project is based on the STM32 micro-controller platform, which offers a wide range of micro-controllers with different performance levels and features.
*  **STM32CubeIDE**: The project was developed using popular IDEs which is STM32CubeIDE, provide tools for code development, debugging, and firmware deployment.
*  **Communication Protocols**: The project includes the implementation of communication protocols such as UART, I2C, SPI, and wireless protocols like BLE .
*  **Peripheral Libraries**: The project utilizes peripheral libraries provided by the micro-controller manufacturer or third-party libraries to simplify the integration and configuration of peripherals.
*  **Other Device**: We integrated a lot of device to increase experiment of customer and performance of device .
*  See our [document](./feature_of_project.md), [system architecture](./assets/others/led_fan_architecture.drawio.svg) and [system design](./assets/pictures/device_diagram.jpg) for more details .

## 2. Features

  <img src="./assets/pictures/clock-fan.jpeg" alt="Project Image" width="700" height="auto">
</p>
The LED CLOCK includes new capabilities such as:

1. **Time and Temperature Display**: The LED FAN can display time (hours, minutes, seconds), dates along with ambient temperature.

2. **Reminders and Notifications**: The user can set alarm, countdowns, along with adjustable audio and RGB LED notifications when the specified time is reached.

3. **Computer Interaction Capability**: The time display on the fan is adjustable through universal asynchronous receiver / transmitter (UART). Users can also update the firmware through a computer.
4. Read our [release note](./RELEASE_NOTE.md) for more details and Look forward to other exciting features in the future . 

## 3. Usage
1. Clone the project repository from [GitHub â†—](https://github.com/NhatKha17/led_fan_pov.git).
2. Set up your development environment with the required IDE (STM32CubeIDE) and toolchain and open the project in the chosen IDE.
3. Read our [diagram](./assets/pictures/device_diagram2.png) to connect the necessary peripherals or sensors to the STM32 micro-controller.
4. Deploy the firmware to the STM32 micro-controller using the appropriate flashing method (e.g., ST-Link, DFU, or BootLoader).

## 4. Protocols
